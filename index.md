# WELCOME TO THE SIGNATURE SOLUTION TOOLKIT

This toolkit compiles some of the innovative and creative tools developed by the Accelerator Labs of RBLAC —until the end of 2023— to achieve sustainable development. Organized according to the six signature solutions of UNDP's Strategic Plan 2022-2025, the toolkit enables other country offices to easily navigate best practices, learn about them, and utilize and replicate them in various contexts.
