## A nearby stores network for digital inclusion 

#### What it does. 
This tool enables you to build a network of nearby stores (markets and shops located within neighborhoods), as a territorial solution, to enhance access to digital services within communities. Through the stores affiliated to the network, neighbors can conveniently conduct various online administrative procedures (such as payments or government requests) close to their homes with the support of shopkeepers. This allows citizens to save time, money, and distance; and benefits nearby stores by increasing their sales.

#### Value proposition for the government/other partner. 
Implementing a network of nearby stores for digital inclusion enables local governments to promote throughout the territory access to digital public services, and to foster economic resilience and growth by boosting stores’ sales. Bringing nearby stores with computers and internet access into the network allows for a more efficient use of existing resources and a reduction of inequalities within the community. 

#### Why and when to use it. 
This tool is most useful when there is a digitized public administrative system with many procedures that must be carried out online or in central offices. It is particularly beneficial when access to both online and in-person procedures is problematic due to financial constraints, distance, and time restrictions. 

#### Known issues and troubleshooting. 
This tool may not be the most suitable choice for you if (1) nearby stores in the community lack technological devices and stable internet connectivity; (2) you do not have supportive partners to assist you.  Such partners include stores owners who should not only be willing to join the network but also be open to learn the necessary skills to assist neighbors with digital administrative procedures. Other key partners are government officials since they can be allies in mobilizing support from store owners and effectively communicating the project to the community. Additionally, governmental partners can help to have a better understanding of the priorities and needs each territory has regarding digital inclusion.

#### Context. 
The Con Vos Network was created to test one of the solutions identified with the potential to achieve higher levels of digital inclusion through the Solutions Mapping of the AccLab. The mapping focused on surveying innovative grassroots solutions, strategies, and tools implemented by people living in low-income neighborhoods during the pandemic to address their daily challenges. These elements served as evidence and/or models to expedite our understanding of various issues from a systemic or global perspective.

Among the solutions identified was the experience of a stationery store owner located in a low-income neighborhood in the Greater Buenos Aires area. She began offering an additional service: assisting her customers with their digital administrative procedures in exchange for a small fee. This case exemplifies the central role played by nearby stores in introducing simple technologies to their neighbors, as in the past was the case of photocopiers, call centers, or mobile phone card recharging. Consequently, these stores become both spaces for meeting the needs of their customers and avenues for them to adopt these new technologies.

#### Cost to implement. 
The cost of implementing this tool can vary from relatively low to moderate, depending on the complexity of the network you intend to establish. A medium-scale implementation, comprehending a network of around 30 nearby stores and a timeframe of four months, could require an estimated budget of USD 60,000 to USD 75,000, which includes the cost of hiring the required team. In addition, you could consider implementing small incentives for shop owners, along with some fieldwork recruiters, all of which could add between USD 10,000 to USD 13,000 to your budget. 

#### Time
The tool is expected to be developed and implemented within a four-month timeframe. The first two months will be devoted to project planning, followed by a two-month on-site implementation phase. Once installed, the network is designed to be self-sustaining.

#### People. 
 To implement this tool, you will need a team of three members:
- One project coordinator responsible for planning, developing, and implementing all aspects of the project. 
- One fieldwork coordinator responsible for overseeing the activities related to the implementation of the project within the territory.
- One communicator dedicated to managing the communicational and design aspects of the project, such as promotional videos or the signage materials for identifying the shops of the network.

Some additional roles can contribute to better results, such as local promoters or field recruiters. They can play a vital role in encouraging both neighbors and shopkeepers to join the network.
