# BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE

Today’s development challenges are dynamic, interconnected puzzles of multidimensional risks that require systemic solutions. The United Nations Development Programme, through its Strategic Plan for 2022-2025, sets out to push towards the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a path forward for overcoming these complex challenges. 

The Plan is grounded in UNDP’s continued commitment to deliver integrated development solutions driven by country priorities. To this end, it is structured around a "3x6x3" framework that aim to support countries in 3 directions of change (structural transformation, leaving no-one behind, building resilience), through 6 signature solutions (poverty and inequality, governance, resilience, environment, energy, gender equality) enhanced by 3 enablers (strategic innovation, digitalization, development financing), that allow UNDP to deliver these solutions through a systemic approach.

This toolkit compiles the tested innovative and creative tools developed by the Accelerator Labs of RBLAC to achieve sustainable development. Organized according to the six UNDP signature solutions, it enables other country offices to easily navigate best practices, learn about them, and aim to utilize and replicate them in various contexts.

As the Accelerator Labs move to contribute more deliberately to UNDP’s R&D function, we offer the experience accumulated by the network of labs in the Latin America and the Caribbean region in the form of this toolkit. It is meant to inspire and empower colleagues by offering ready-made resources that can be re-used after adapting then to a new context.

The toolkit aims to facilitate collective intelligence initiatives and is conceived as a "living" site, hoping to continuously expand the available tools.
